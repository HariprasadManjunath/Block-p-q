# Block-p-q
Block diagonalization of p-q-tridiagonal matrices


This is a collection of functions for block diagonal reduction of (p,q)-Tridiagonal matrices.

Genaral Usage : 


Example usage with ones along p-th upper and q-th lower diagonals and remaining entries zero.

[A Ab] = BDpqE(n,p,q)

For a general (p,q)-tridiagonal matrix.

[Ab] = BDpqT(T,n,p,q)
